NY Times Mini
eggelette - winner (2025)
The epee strikes fast, 
Feet moving in soft clay, 
The die has been cast, 
Olaf, Olav, Olat, 
Who can really say? 

New Habits burn bright, 
Age and live well by the sabre, 
This mini one is alright, 
Well worth the competitive labour. 

The American removes you, 
Adds a letter or two to a word, 
Clues even combine few, 
To discombobulate the herd, 

It is a distressing discourse, 
Disentangling on discord, 
Distractions and distortions, 
discerning its designs.
