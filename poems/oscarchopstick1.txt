Fly, sprint, run 
Gently brush against my buns 
Table, hands, grip 
Wrestling I stare only at your lips 

Tell me tales of Nex and Millicent 
But don't pretend to be so innocent 
My ears hear but the words go adrift 
I'm too distracted by your scent I sniffed 

Polyglot? What a talented tongue 
I can't help but be jealous of the songs it has sung 
Wrapped around the words, teasing them out 
Your chest so full, could almost be a shout 

Your chest, oh my, pressed against mine 
To have you, to hold you, damn that ass fine 
Your arms around me, my heart aflutter 
My manhood ready, my mind in the gutter 

And yet your heart belongs to another 
My nemesis Astarion, whom can never be my brother 
The adventures you've been on, the things you've seen 
Wasn't I there with you, haven't I been? 

Demons and Mechs, Lords and Witches 
Calamitas just another of our ex bitches 
To be constantly carried, I feel often an imposition 
But I know Alpha daddy, you enjoy my submission 

I know you've seen other men shower, and it pains my soul 
But I can't begrudge your indulgences, when I think of the toll 
To be swinging such a weapon, a sword, a warhead 
It can't be easy to take it to your bed 

So I made you this poem, this ballad, this verse 
A testament and tribute, to your pride and your curse 
The weight you carry, your low centre of gravity 
Your ridiculous tool that fuels my depravity 

So here's to you, and here's to your cock 
I'm always here ready, waiting for you to dock
