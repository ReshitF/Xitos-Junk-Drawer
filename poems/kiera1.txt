I am the echo
of someone elseâ€™s bond
the almost friend 
the just there enough
 to not be missed when gone
 
They smile when they see me 
I'm not invisible 
just forgettable 
Like a song you hum 
but don't know the words to 

Is my purpose only to make others feel less alone 
When do I become a song worth singing
