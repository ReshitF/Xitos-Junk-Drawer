You were always telling me, 
To listen to what you said. 
You were always saying, 
You knew what would be best. 
You never got to show me how, 
To stand all on my own. 
I had to learn it by myself, 
When I was all alone. 
But now that I’ve grown up, 
I can understand. 
You were only saying you loved me, 
When you took me by the hand, 
And showed me I was wrong, 
When I was on the ground. 
You picked me right back up, 
After I had fallen down. 
I was angry for so long, 
Hurt, betrayed, and sad. 
Even though you had no choice, 
With just how much time we had. 
It would never be enough, 
But I know just what you’d say. 
Be thankful we had time at all, 
Be grateful for each day. 
If only you could see me now. 
If only you could see what I’ve become. 
You only knew me then, 
Back when I was young. 
If only you could see me now. 
If only you could see all that you’ve done. 
Turned out to be the best for me, 
Shaped me into all that I’ve become.
