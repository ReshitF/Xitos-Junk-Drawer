You're the Dungeon Master full of flair 
You summon plots by doing lots of steps 
We fight your goblins, dodge your traps 
(While RuneScape runs in twenty five tabs) 

Each morning brings our sacred test 
The New York Times mini your daily quest 
You finish quick, your smug face glows 
But now and then... I win, Who knows? 

Between the crosswords and RuneScape grinds 
You curse Dutch transport at least three times 
You tap your foot, you pace, you glare, 
As if impatience could change the state of affairs 

Youâ€™re a legend in Apex carrying me through 
clutching those W's like only you do 
Happy birthday my friend (couldn't think of a cool way to end it rhyming frick) 

This was so bad but we have to honour the birthday boy
